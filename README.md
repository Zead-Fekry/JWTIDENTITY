JWT (JSON Web Token): A compact, URL-safe token that is used to represent claims between two parties. It consists of three parts:

Header (contains the type of token and signing algorithm)
Payload (contains the claims, like user data or permissions)
Signature (validates that the token hasn’t been tampered with)
Identity in JWT: The identity in this context typically refers to a user’s unique information (e.g., user ID, email) embedded in the token’s payload. This identity can be verified without querying a database each time a request is made, which makes JWT tokens efficient for stateless authentication.

JWT Identity System:

Users log in and receive a JWT token that includes their identity and roles/permissions.
The token is stored on the client side (usually in local storage or cookies).
With every request, the token is sent back to the server, where it is validated.
Once validated, the server knows the user’s identity and can grant or deny access to resources based on the claims.
Common Use Cases:

Stateless API authentication.
Single Sign-On (SSO).
Token-based user sessions in distributed systems.
Advantages:

Decouples the authentication process from the server, enabling scalability.
Lightweight and easy to transmit in HTTP headers.
Provides a way to handle authentication in distributed systems and microservices.
